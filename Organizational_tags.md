* Additional notes
    * are color-coded by group in the PEP process
    * main categories have a (none) as no item should be tagged that generally, use a subtopic tag
    * only one tag per PEP should be used so it can be slotted in the handbook in a single location
    * considered adding the category (like 'Operations') to the tag but instead placed it at the end of the description in the PEP tags
