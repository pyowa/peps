# Steering Committee

* made up of whoever attends weekly steering commitee meetings (due to this current arrangement, there may be an even number of attendees. In this case, for EACH separate vote during this session one member will be chosen at random to abstain from that vote in order to avoid ties. Paper, Rock, Scissors is an encouraged randomizer if desired.)
* makes decisions on PEP submissions
* responsible for Pyowa monthly meeting scheduling and operations
* future ideas for when organization can sustain it:
    * maintain an odd count, minimum of 3, so votes do not tie
    * positions should last two years but can be extended if no one is stepping in to replace or if the count is being expanded (like from 3 to 5)
